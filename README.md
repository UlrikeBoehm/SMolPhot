# About

SMolPhot is an open-source operating system independent data analysis and visualization software package for data acquired by single molecule localization microscopy methods such as photo-activation localization microscopy. SMolPhot is written in python which make it platform independent and easy to develop open source software package.

# Main features

* Easy to use: one click installer for most operating systems (Windows, Linux, Mac) 
* Pre-processors for noise filtering and background subtraction; 
* Uses astigmatism approach as a z-calibration tool for 3D localization; 
* Includes local-maxima, blob-detection and connected-component localization algorithms; 
* 2D and 3D Gaussian point spread functions for fitting; 
* Post-processing which filters molecules according to localization goodness classified by standard deviation of fitting parameters or any linear combinations of them defined by user.
* Applies temporal correlation for enhancing localization accuracy by combining locations of single molecule over multiple frames.
